It has a nominal (85%) filtration rating of 5 microns. The filter will reduce free available chlorine (FAC) at 2 parts per million (ppm) by at least 90% in up to 22,000 gallons at a flow rate of 2 gallons per minute (gpm). This cartridge is made of bonded powdered activated carbon (PAC) filter media wrapped in a polyolefin pre-filter with polyethylene outer netting. The nitrile butadiene rubber (Buna-N) gaskets seal the cartridge against the housing (sold separately). The cartridge has an initial pressure drop of 4.3 pounds per square inch (psi) at a flow rate of 2 gallons per minute (gpm), and operates over a temperature range of 40 to 180 degrees F (4.4 to 82.2 degrees C). This carbon block filter cartridge meets National Sanitation Foundation/American National Standards Institute (NSF/ANSI) standard 42 for quality assurance, and is used for purification of residential and commercial drinking water.SpecificationsNominal filtration rating5 micronsInitial pressure drop at 2 gpm4.3 psiChlorine reduction capacity22,000 gallons at 2 gpmTemperature range40 to 180 degrees F (4.4 to 82.2 degrees C)Maximum dimensions (H x W)9-3/4 x 4-5/8 inches (248 x 118 mm)Materials certificationNSF/ANSI standard 42The nominal filtration rating is for a particle removal efficiency of 85%.

They are made of densely packed synthetic or natural fibers that trap suspended particles, materials that block microbes or adsorb unwanted chemicals, or substances that cause a chemical change, such as acid neutralization. For most residential, commercial, and industrial applications, water filters are manufactured in the form of replaceable cartridges that fit inside permanent housings. Filtration systems typically consist of a series of two or more types of filters, each designed to remove different contaminants. The performance of filters is measured by the minimum particle size that is blocked, the percentage of particles or microorganisms that are removed, the downstream concentration of unwanted chemicals, the maximum flow rate, and the amount of water that can be filtered before the filter must be replaced. Water filters are used in a wide range of applications, including drinking water purification, swimming pools, industrial processes, and irrigation, among others.Pentair manufactures industrial, commercial, and residential water filtration components and systems. The company, founded in 1966 and headquartered in Minneapolis, MN, meets International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards 9001 and 14001 for quality assurance."

LeafsOut gutter guard can be installed on various gutter types such as Ogee, half round, fascia, curved and box. It can also be installed on various types of roofs such as asphalt shingle, wood shake, flat tile, Spanish tile and stone coated steel. Installation: The front aluminum edge has a stop that will push up against the inside front edge of the rain gutter and a rest that will fit on top of the front edge and can be screwed on with included self tapping screws. The back edge slides in between the roof and the roof shingles. We recommend the micro mesh to be at an angle between 5 and 15 degrees. A higher angle may result in water running of the mesh instead of into the gutter. If the angle is steep the back of the mesh can be bent and attached to the fascia board."

351,B005TLMBHK,"Induction cooking produces heat through the production of magnetic fields. This is an extremely energy efficient cooking method using approximately 90 percent of the energy produced. When used with magnetic cookware the electrical energy utilized by the induction cooker is transmitted directly to the pan surface. It is the pan not the burner that heats up. In addition to being efficient, this allows for very responsive temperature adjustments. Induction is also an extremely safe method of cooking. Once the pan is removed from the cooker, the energy transfer stops and the cook plate is soon cool to the touch. This single burner, portable induction cook top is designed for domestic use.

367,B007B64O0S,"Portable Induction Cooktop, 1500 watt  Cooktop Stays Cool  This Nesco Induction Cooktop provides the best in cooktop performance. Uses less energy and provides practically instant heat and since there are no open flames or hot coils, is safer to use than conventional burners. It allows for instant control of cooking energy for precise cooking control. Induction cooktops are designed to be used with ferromagnetic material like Cast Iron, Steel, Enameled Cast Iron, Enameled Steel or Stainless Steel. If a magnet sticks to your cookware, it will work on an induction cooktop. When a ferromagnetic cookware is placed on the ceramic surface, currents are induced in the cookware and instant heat is generated due to the resistance of the pan. The magnetic properties of the steel in the cookware will concentrate the induced current and generate heat. Once cookware is removed, all molecular activity ceases. Heat is generated at the cookware only so the cooktop stays cool. Will not work with Aluminum, Copper or Glass cookware.  Easy to Clean, No More Burned on Spills  Features:  1500 Watts Safer for families, small children, handicapped and the elderly Use where hotplates would be dangerous or not allowed Rapid Heating Noiseless, except quiet fan Energy efficient (84%) RV's � Camping - Patio  Detailed Highlights: Instant Temperature Adjustments: 5 touch controls; melt/warm, simmer, boil, fry and sear. Durable Ceramic Glass Top: Easy to clean and no more burned on spills. Greater Heat Consistency: Heat is generated at the cookware only so the cook-top stays cool. Comes With Test Magnet for Ferrous Metal Cookware: Cook-top designed to be used with ferromagnetic material like Cast Iron, Steel, Enameled Cast Iron, Enameled Steel or Stainless Steel. Test cookware you already own or take the magnet to the store with you to buy new cookware.  We purposely only put five settings on our induction cooktop because we wanted to make it easy and simple to use.  Our induction cooktop has been used by quite a few people, including professional chefs and a culinary school and has received rave reviews from all. Everyone loves the five settings and the simplicity of the unit and the superior performance.  Trouble Shooting Steps:   E0 - Circuit error occurred within the appliance. Allow to cool, then unplug from electrical outlet. Repeat cooking mode as desired. E1 - No cookware present, unsuitable type or diameter is too small (less than 3.15 inches.). E2 - Internal appliance overheat. Appliance will automatically turn off. Allow to cool and unplug from electrical outlet. Check that vents are clear of obstructions. E3 - Input voltage is greater than 140 V.a.c. E4 - Input voltage is less than 95 V.a.c. E5 - Main sensor detects disconnection or short circuit. Do not attempt to repair, contact the manufacturer for further information. E6 - Heating Zone temperature has overheated. Appliance will automatically turn off. After cooling fan has turned off, unplug from electrical outlet, remove cookware and allow to cool.    Greater Heat Consistency  About Induction: This form of flameless cooking has certain advantages over conventional gas flame and electric cookers, as it provides rapid heating, improved thermal efficiency, and greater heat consistency, yet with precise control similar to gas. In situations in which a hotplate would typically be dangerous or illegal, an induction plate is ideal, as it creates no heat itself. The high efficiency of power transfer into the cooking vessel makes heating food faster on an induction cooking surface than on other electric cooking surfaces. Because of the high efficiency, an induction element has heating performance comparable to a typical consumer-type gas element, even though the gas burner would have a much higher power input. Induction cookers are safer to use than conventional cookers because there are no open flames. The surface below the cooking vessel is no hotter than the vessel; only the pan generates heat. The control system shuts down the element if a pot is not present or not large enough. Induction cookers are easy to clean because the cooking surface is flat and smooth. And because the cooking surface is not directly heated; spilled food does not burn on the surface. Since heat is being generated by an induced electric current, the unit can detect whether cookware is present by monitoring how much power is being absorbed. That allows functions such as keeping a pot at minimal boil when cookware is removed. This unit will beep until the turned off. Because the cook top is shallow compared to a gas-fired or electrical coil cooking surface, wheelchair access can be improved; the user's legs can be below the counter height and the user's arms can reach over the top. Going ""Green""? Induction is the way to go: Induction cooktops transfer energy from the cooktop to the pan more efficiently than any other cooktop technology. Induction cooking is the latest, greenest technology. Below is a Energy Factor comparison indicating Gas around .40, electric around .70 and induction .84. Note the higher the number the better the energy factor.    So what do we take away from all of this? Looking at the energy factor induction has the highest (best) score of 0.84 - almost 20% better than any other electric cooktop and twice the score of the nearest gas option."

Tip #2 Make sure the floor is level, with no more than a one-inch slope.     Tip #3 If installing a laundry pair, ensure that there are hot and cold water lines within three feet of washer hookups.   Tip #4 For an electric dryer you will need a three-prong outlet with a 30-amp circuit.

400,B009Q4D4D6,"Proslat has created a new wall storage solution with standards which are above the ordinary, backed by service that goes beyond the norm. Our PVC slatwall panels are the result of two years of research and development. The result of this research is an industry-leading patented PVC slatwall panel that is stronger, greener, simpler and less expensive than our competitors. Our full line of garage storage accessories may be mixed and matched to provide a customized storage solution. Each wall panel is made of high density PVC and can hold up to 75 lbs per linear foot per slat. Our patented design puts the mounting screws above the hook cavity which allows for maximum strength. Our design transfers the workload to the screw, which relieves the pressure – the screw is carrying the workload, not the panel. Our PVC slatwall panels are not affected by mold, mildew, or water so you can install them in those damp locations. Impact testing indicates that a Proslat wall panel is up to 25 times more impact resistant than drywall. We stand behind our panels with a 10 year limited warranty. Our patented hidden screw design makes anyone look like a professional. Miss a stud? No problem – simply remove and reposition the screw and the next panel will hide the blunder. Panels can be cut with a circular saw or a jigsaw. The result is a clean professional finish with absolutely no visible mounting screws. Proslat wall panels are produced using 90-Degree recycled material, making them one of the greenest storage solutions on the market today. Proslat systems are versatile. You may install an entire wall, a section of a wall, or a track around the wall. This flexibility puts you in charge of the design. You can change the configuration – or add to your design -- at any time. Each box comes with 10 wall panels covering an 8-foot L by 4-foot H section or 32 total square feet (each panel measures 5 ¾-inch H x 8-foot L; because panels interlock, the exposed or finished size is 4 ¾-inch H x 8-foot L). Proslat also offers a wide range of accessories that allow you to easily organize your space. Enhance your slatwall with hooks, baskets, shelves and bins and the Proslat wall panel design makes it easy to add, remove or change the way you organize your space. Our wide selection of hooks, baskets and shelving is designed to give you maximum flexibility today and for many years to come. These hanging solutions are all made from high grade steel. We designed our backplates to disperse the working load throughout the wall so you can hang whatever you want without worrying. Powder coated finish adds durability and larger hooks feature rubber tips for safety. To view these items, type “Proslat hooks”, “Proslat baskets” or “Proslat shelves” in the search bar. Proslat also offers the Probin, the storage bin that offers maximum storage options. We designed our translucent Probins with a high load bearing capacity despite their lightweight construction. They are great for storing those products (like oil cans and soap containers) that often leak onto the floor. Probins are easy to wash; you can even put them in the dishwasher. To view these items, type “Proslat Probins” in the search bar. If you are looking for a technologically advanced panel that is the strongest, greenest and simplest, Proslat is the solution for you."

Mylar bags and oxygen absorbers protect from mold, bugs, and oxidation for over 25 years.Things to consider:Pick a reputable manufacturer to insure your bag is an excellent oxygen barrier. Importers who buy “mylar bags” off of Alibaba often don’t realize those bags are PET, which is not Mylar as claimed. They are thick and cheap, taking advantage of the common feeling that thicker must be better. It is metalization that keeps oxygen out, not PET.Only store food that does not need refrigeration. Use a plastic container for extra physical protection and store in a cool, dark place off of the ground. Use extra absorption to lengthen storage time. Unused absorbers may be stored in a mason jar or vacuum sealed. All Mylar bags must be heat-sealed, (even zip locks) which is easily done with an iron or hair-straightening iron.
