If not, how do you clean it?",,"Hi Marlene, First I should point out this product is not really a filter. It's a wick that absorbs and holds moisture so the blower fan can push air through it and drive the water into the surrounding environment. How often it needs replacing depends upon how often the humidifier cycles and on the mineral content of your water. If you run your humidifier a lot and you are not using filtered water, then these wicks typically need replacing about every three months (at least). I use filtered water in my humidifier to reduce the mineral content but I still have to replace the wick every 5-6 months. It's pretty simple to determine when your wick is clogged with minerals because the humidifier will basically run non-stop as there will be no moisture in the wick therefore no moisture going into the air. These wicks are not really cleanable because they are too fragile. Once they get clogged with minerals (i.e. ""lime"") they need to be disposed of and replaced.",1.151030725926346

Exhausting to the eve of the house is more economical and reduces the cost/risk of cutting thru the roof and the potential water leak etc. The elbow and aluminum exhaust pipes that I purchased at Home Depot (very economical) do not have to be sealed since they fit into one another tightly. One thing that I noticed on my hood is that the light switch occasionally stick when I try to turn the light on. Although I have not done it, I am sure that a bit of WD40 sprayed on the side of the switch would do the job. Considering the cost of this product, it is an excellent value. The unit is very easy to install. We are retired and we would buy this item again. We have stainless steel appliances and this hood matches seamless. To impress family and friends there are other hoods that would do the job at higher costs. I suggest that you follow the installation instructions as far as the distance of the hood from the top of the stove. Too close to the top of the stove will impede your working room, too far from the top of the stove, will diminish its power to exhaust the heat properly.

Now, elements usually break for the lack of cooling or air flow, so if you put a new element but nobody at home is removing the old lint, the new element is going to burn again. Use your hand and arm and make sure there is no blockage whatsoever inside the duct. Regarding model, before I purchased I went to several sites and found that they are very similar.

I contacted the vendor and he offered to accept the filters in return and refund the purchase. Since he seemed willing to stand behind his product, I kept the filters. About 5 weeks later I needed to replace the filter. When I installed the new one and tried to flush water through it I discovered the same phenomenon that you describing: I believe what both you and I saw is activated charcoal which being released.

I emailed them immediately after installing the defective filter. He responded immediately by crediting my charge card and saying I did not need to return the filters. He explained that they were purchased from a supplier that for other reasons he was no longer affiliated with.

If you are a serious cook, you will love it as well. I love the way I can control the heat of the range and I believe it rivals any gas cook top. I would much prefer the cook top of this range to a gas cook top as the solid surface is easy to maintain, it has warning signals if something boils over and nothing heats up if a pan is not on the surface. I have a very powerful microwave and have done a head to head comparison of bringing water to a boil. This range beats the microwave hands down. In fact, your cooking style will change due to the rapid pace of heating. I love the control I have when making heat sensitive dishes such as gravies, stove top custards and dishes that require high control of heat. The first couple weeks I kept calling my wife over to look at how much better things were cooking up. The ovens are excellent as well. I have not used the lower oven much at all but it would be handy if you are cooking for a large group or need to keep something warm while something else occupies the large oven. Some cool unexpected things regarding this oven is it can be used as a food dryer as well as to proof bread (low heat for yeast breads to rise). The oven has more controls than any mere mortal would ever use. It actually has certain modes for some religious holidays; not making that up. I have seen no downside to the ovens. They are awesome. After three years of use, I truly see no down side to this range at all. I understand that there is a range out there now that will heat a pan no matter where it is placed on the surface. I guess that would be cool but probably would not change the way I cook at all. I highly suggest this range. It would get 6 stars on a 5 star scale.",1.9595543682976189

If you have flat counters like granite then it might work. The edge if your counter may need to be flat and not curve up too. There may be accessories to accommodate the curve but you'd have check on electrolux's website. There should be a fitment guide pdf guide there. The main concern is the slide in is designed slide over the counter so its nearly flush with the counter. If you have tile with a round edge on the left and right if the stove you won't be able to get the stove top flat with the counters and it won't look right. Even if you satisfy the flat countertop requirement, you will ideally want a small strip of countertop behind the stove to fill the gap between the backsplash and the back of the stove. Slide in ranges are designed to look like counter top stoves and the trim piece on the stove is designed to be flush with the countertop on 3 sides (left, behind, right). Although I've seen optional accessories for placing a ""dummy"" filler piece behind the stove to fill the gap on back, you'd have to check the website or ask an appliance retailer. With all that being said, I would just buy the Electrolux free standing induction version if that is the stove/counter configuration you have now. It will be a direct replacement.

Additionally, the new HE detergent is made to have less suds, since the new washers use less water and more enzymes to break down the dirt. So you would only need to be concerned if you had a new HE washer and put too much soap in your wash, as your clothes wouldn't be free of the soap at the end. The main thing we will all notice by using HE stamped detergent is less suds in our traditional top loader.",2.4521812012443025

4569,open-ended,B004H3XWPG,"Nov 8, 2013",1383897600.0,I have a GE Profile side by side refrigerator model PSS26MSRSS. The water dispenser just trickles water. It also makes a little noise while it dispenses water. I tried defrosting water line. That is not the answer. The Ice maker &amp; dispensor works fine....,,"Several possible causes of problems with water to dispenser. Troubleshooting tips: 1. Check to see if the ice maker is still working. If so, the problem is probably not caused by a water filter problem since the water to the ice maker has to go through the filter also. 2. Disconnect water tubing connector at bottom of refrigerator where it enters the freezer door. Then press water dispenser switch. If water comes out of the disconnected line then the problem is probably a frozen water line in the freezer door. Reconnect the line and defrost the freezer. If the problem occurs again there are other measures that can be taken to prevent freezing. 3. Turn off power, remove cover and valve bracket on the back of the unit, and pull the valve assembly out where you can get to it. There are two valves. The first valve is the inlet valve and must open whenever the ice maker or the water dispenser operates. The second valve has two separate outlets - one for the ice maker and one for the freezer. There is a short tubing from the outlet of the first valve to the inlet of the second valve. Disconnect this tubing by pressing in on the connector while pulling out on the tube. Direct the open end of the tube toward a pan. Then keeping clear of all electrical wires, plug the refrigerator back in. Press the water dispenser. If water does not come out of the inlet valve, the valve is probably bad. If it does come out, it is probably the second valve. You can run a similar test on the second valve if the first valve proves to be okay. 4. If you are comfortable with your do-it-yourself skills, you can also use a voltmeter to confirm that the valve is receiving 110 volts when the water dispenser is depressed. I even went so far as to jumper the water dispenser connector to the ice maker side of the valve to confirm that that side would open when I depressed the water dispenser. Be careful if you try these because you are working with 110 volt power. If the valve is not getting 110v power when the dispenser is depressed, it is probably due to either a bad controller board or a bad electrical connection.",5.83078642113818

You turn off dishwasher, turn off water, push the red release button on coupler (releases any water pressure) then you uncouple and then I pull the hose upward from the back to drain water still in hose. Certain cycles heat the water so you'll want to pull open the door and let the steam out and the dishes (hot) will finish drying. The manual is not written well, but it's not rocket science, so you'll figure it out. But you leave hot on until it finishes the cycle (also, the red light that flashes while running, goes solid red when cycle is over). It has a lot of options, so you'll want to read it carefully. But it's a good dishwasher. Which reminds me... I'd better load mine up... again :)",5.237246417517355

Plus all Speed Queen top loaders have a soak cycle that should help with the grease but I have not had to use it yet. One minor nit with the soak cycle is that after it is done you then have to run the load through a entire regular cycle but an easy workaround suggested by other owners is to use the regular cycle but lift the lid on the washer after the initial fill to let the load soak. After it soaks for a while just close the iid to run the load through the rest of the cycle. You can't do this with a modern HE machine.

None of the other models operate with the constant slow agitation feature in a complete cycle.

However, the loudest part is actually quite loud, and lasts maybe 30 seconds. The first time I heard it, I thought something was wrong with the washer, but after talking to a technician, was assured it was normal. I think it happens at the end of the rinse cycle, when the tub is spinning very fast, and water is pouring in for the rinse, and the clothes are getting compressed against the side. Due to this, at some point the clothes are no longer covering the bottom of the washer, and the water pouring in is hitting the empty bottom of the metal tub directly.

I loosened the four screws that hold down the glass cover, lifted it up a bit and could easily see the light housings. They are held in only with a clip, and by pushing down they come out easily. (You could probably just pry them out from underneath with a thin knife blade, working carefully so as not to scratch the surface.) The housing is connected with a plug to the 12V DC circuit that powers the LEDS. You can dismantle the housing by removing 4 small (PH-0) Philips head screws. That allows you to see the circular circuit board that holds 9 surface-mounted LEDs. The device is rated 12 Volts DC and less than 2 watts, meaning the current draw is less than 0.167 amps. Someone who knows the current market in LED surface mount devices could probably locate a circular board of similar size that contained some higher lumen output LEDs. (The technology on these is improving rapidly.) Or the manufacturer could get smart and get some themselves and offer us replacement plug-in units. But none of this helps you now. I was surprised how bright the 9 little bulbs were, and first thought maybe the diffuser was the problem in diminishing light output. But when I held the circuit board up in position without the diffuser and turned off the kitchen light, I could still see that the output was too slight. Anyway, although it doesn't immediately solve our problem of a low-lumen light, it was fun research. I took pictures, but can't figure out how they might be posted here.",0.19669450425213594

This kit comes with the Main thermostat, 1 outdoor sensor and 1 Portable Comfort Control (PCC). The PCC can be moved around the house. In my case, I have a 2 story house and I keep the PCC in the second floor, at night when I am in the room I transfer the control from downstairs (main unit) to the PCC and the temperature in the room is kept at my preferred setting (Usually 78/79). There is a drawback: The Main thermostast and the PCC cannot be used at the same time in tandem, so you are reading the temp either from the main or from the PCC but not both at the same time. For example if I set downstairs to be 80 and the PCC to be 79 the A/C will not turn on to keep both settings, only to keep the one that at that moment is the master (either the main unit or the PCC). If you want to keep an average setting in your house, like having multiple sensors indoor and that the AC turns on to keep this average, then there are small indoor units (no screen) that are cheap that can be used for that.",1.6762158036753094

It has a limited capacity, but it keeps the diapers out of the regular household laundry. For busy people it may be impractical beyond infant and early toddler size diapers. But that depends on how much you mind doing several loads a week. I wouldn't mind at all. Cloth diapers are the healthiest. Babies do NOT need all the ridiculous chemicals in disposables. I say that with a little authority. I used to work in a research and development department of a baby diaper manufacturing company. Trust me. Cloth diapers are healthier than disposables. I would never let a disposable touch my baby if I didn't have to. As for the egg, you could probably get a dozen and a half newborn diapers in it. Probably eight to twelve toddler diapers. I don't think it is such a pain to hook up to a faucet that is in a second bathroom or a utility room. Otherwise it would be kind of a pain n a kitchen or only bathroom. The full wash is about thirty minutes. Wash and no rise is about fifteen. Just remember to turn the water off before removing the hose from the faucet! I wish my mom had it in the 1950's and 1960's when she had eight children and several in cloth diapers at any given time. I was an oldest daughter and often changed the cloth diapers and rinsed them in the toilet. Then put them in the bleach pail. I would have loved the ego egg. Just take the diapers out of the pail and put them in the egg. Run it and then wring them out. Throw them in the dryer or hang them up.

It took a total of about 13 to 14 hours in a whole day for me to install mostly by myself. My wife did help me load it up into the packaging box that it came in. We use the box on top of the stove to support this range to help ease the load of loading it under our cabinet. This sucker weight like 40 to 50 pounds. Some of the nut and bolt that came with the package doesn't feel secure for me. I don't wanted the whole range drop down. I end up using toggle bolt that can handle 80+ lbs. each and use them on the top of the cabinet and use heavy duty dry wall anchor and screws that support 30+ lbs. for the side. This thing wasn't going anyway. For the perfect next time I think I well drill hole that was 1/4"" bigger for running the power cord thru it. I end being slight not level on the range due to the cord bushing of the power cord on fitting the hole so it bumped 2cm higher and not set flat on it. Mounting the four top screw was a pain.

8773,open-ended,B00G9EHGDK,"Sep 20, 2014",1411196400.0,Can it wash 1 or 2 towels at a time?,,"I have owned this machine for a few months now, and consider it a great purchase. I will answer your question, though ... by explaining how I use it because I have gone through quite a bit of trial and error, and now set it up in the best way that works for me. First I get the lid to a large plastic tote bins that I have. ( Something you can find at probably every dollar store, Walmart etc ) and lay it TOP DOWN in my bathtub. This prevents the water from submerging the bottom of the machine in any way. Then, I fill the washer side ( making sure the dial is set on WASH first ) using the hand held shower head I have. It works just fine. I don't need to use any fancy hoses, levers, etc. I know a lot of people out there do that. This works best for me. As for soap, I either dilute a laundry pod ( as I have a bunch of them anyway ) in SIX CUPS of water ( you will have TONS left over ) and use 1 TEASPOON of that, per load .. or one teaspoon of regular liquid laundry soap. I usually turn on the machine about half a second just to see suds in the water.. I don't think it's needed though. Now, this is what I do per clothing item per load: ( for two people living in my home ) - NO MORE then 5-6 tops - NO MORE then 3-4 pants ( depending on their thickness. Jeans, two per load ) - Under clothing items, I always have a lot and I always throw them all in, but be prepared to untangle socks .. so if you do not want to do that,do your socks in small loads orput them into a THICKKKKKKKKKKKK laundry bag. ( I say thick because this machine will tear the regular small ones to absolute shreds ) - Bedding, yep, bedding ... I do the cover sheet AND the top sheet together. If you want, it can handle two pillow cases along with. I don't do that, I wash the pillow cases ( cuz there is four total ) with my tops. Works fine. - Do not, do not, do NOT wash ANY blankets in this machine other then baby blankets. - Towels .. now we have standard, large towels and I will NEVER again put more then two in at a time. As well, I will NEVER put more then 3/4th a teaspoon of laundry soap in with the towels because they REALLY REALLY suds up the machine. It doesn't matter how may times you rinse, it causes tons of suds. You will be rinsing for hours, or have to take the towels out and rinse by hand. I do all wash clothes, dish towels, hand towels together. ( Usually 7-9 pieces total ) The times I have found that work best per clothing item per load: (Seriously, screw what the numbers say or what the booklet suggests ) Tops - 5-7 minutes if you have heavily soiled tops, I don't see an issue with going as much as 9 minutes. Also, if they are delitcate tops, lace, etc .. 3-4 works fine. Pants - 7-10 minutes. Heavily soiled, 10 might still be enough, but go ahead and add more if they are like muddy, etc. ( In which case, you don't wannal oad the machine up too much with mud etc) Under clothing - I run em the full 15 minutes. Works great. Towels, 13-15. After washing is done, drain. Then refill to rinse. You have to do this or your clothes are gonna be sudsy. Go ahead and leave clothing in machine while your draining and refilling. Then, run the rinse for HALF the amount of time you just washed. Then drain the machine again, take cloths out of the wash and put into the spinner. Now, for every load, you wanna SPLIT it in half to spit. For example, if you just washed four pairs of thin pants, put two in at a time. ( The spin side is smaller anyway ) Five shirts, two first, then three next. Towels ONE AT A TIME. The hand towels and etc, I spin all at once , or split in two loads, it works fine. Then hang up or throw in dryer if you have one. Now it was dead of summer where I live when I got this and its cooled now to 80s ... our clothes take the entire day to dry, unless you got a fan blowing on it. I have hung laundry on hangers for more then ten years, so this does not bother me. I know I have said lots here but I truly love this machine. It has saved money at the laundrymat and saves energy... however, be prepared to be messing with your machine quite awhile on laundry day unless you use it for washing odds and ends. Also, I would STRONGLY advise NOT using any liquid fabric softner. I am very sensitive to the stuff personally, but can tell ya, this machine doesn't really get it out real well.

8778,open-ended,B00G9EHGDK,"Nov 21, 2014",1416556800.0,how to use it without getting caught by the owner water usage i want to buy one,,"It's a small enough machine so you can hide it in your closet when not in use. Not too noisy either. Water usage is about 1.5-2 buckets full of water, plus what you use for rinsing. It's less than what you'd use filling up your bathtub for a bath... When I use this, I use the method we used to use when I was a child and haven't had an automated washer. This method will save you water, too. : Fill the washer part with water. Warmer water should be used for whites. Fill up a bucket or a children size tub with colder water for rinsing. Separate your laundry by colours, and start the wash with whites. When the whites are done, twist them over the washer, so the water will stay in the washer, then put the laundry into the bucket filled for rinsing. Then put the next, darker coloured bunch of laundry into the same water in the washer. Wash it, and during that rinse you whites in the bucket, then twist or squeeze them before placing them in the spining part of the machine. Once spinned, shake the items to reduce wrinkles, then hang them on a drying rack or wire or hanger to dry. Same to do with the darker colours. As you get ahead with the process, the water temperature will be reduced as well by time. You'll save water, gas or electricity to heat the water and probably time as well. As said earlier, for one wash for all or most colours you use less water than using by having a bath or a long shower. Obviously if it is more than one person's laundry, you might need a bit more water and time, but the amount of water used will be still less than having a bath each. I hope this helps. And one more thing. Sometimes landlords don't want washers installed in apartments, because of lack of space or because they are afraid of leakage. I can assure you that you can spill more water by handwashing your stuff at home in the bathroom than by using this washer carefully, not to mention that those landlords would not think of such options as this portable washer. I'd might go to my landlord and ask for permission, rather than hiding it and doing laundry secretly. But all circumstances differ as all people are different.",2.0691619315161076

How long will they keep staple foods such as beans, rice and lentils fresh?",,"Hello, All Mylar bags must be heat-sealed to be effective. There are a few ways of doing this but I think the most common is to simply use a household iron. I have also heard of using a hair iron, which should work as long as it gets hot enough. The recommended sealing temperature is 400 degrees. They sell impulse sealers that work well but are not really worth it unless you plan on sealing a lot of bags. We usually recommend you rotate your food supply every year or two by actually using it. However, when properly sealed, low moisture food like you are storing can stay fresh indefinitely as it is protected from oxidation, bugs, light, mold, and oxygen dependent organisms. If you plan on extended storage, be sure to use quality American Mylar as small holes in the foil layer can let oxygen in whether the bag has been punctured or not, no matter how thick the entire laminate material is.

There is a popular misconception that there is one Mylar film and the thicker, the better. Actually, there are many kinds of Mylar films which consist of layers of different materials that serve different purposes. Mylar itself is a transparent member of the polyester family that is remarkably strong. The Mylar in this film has a bursting strength of 69 pounds per square inch so it can withstand a lot of abuse. In order to make the film a protective barrier to oxygen, a foil layer is added. (oxygen cannot go through glass or metal) This foil layer can be disturbed by folding, moving or filling the bag and you can sometimes see a scratch or a separation during regular use but these are not holes in the film and do not significantly effect the performance of the bag. Mylar bags from Pack Fresh are made here in Southern California and have never been shipped until you buy them. That is how we can afford to compete with the other discount ""mylar"" that comes from China. There are some enlightening Washington Post articles that should make it clear why American-made products such as those from Pack Fresh are superior.

Are the bags shipped so that they do not get creased causing leaks?,?,"Hello, I am glad you asked this here so that others can read this as well because this pops up from time to time. Mylar is one of the toughest flexible materials ever created. The film we use to make these can take the weight of two and a half cinder blocks EVERY square inch... and folding does not hurt it. (Still, we do ship orders of 3 or more in a large box as long as it is not Fulfilled by Amazon) But Mylar film is transparent. It looks metallic because a separate layer of aluminum has been added to the Mylar. Normal use, even filling it or moving it, will cause tiny breaks in the foil layer that you may sometimes see if you hold it to the light - but don't worry, they are not holes.

But just so you know.. there is not great deal of size difference between the large and small. The way that the maker works it fills an area with water then it lowers 9 rods into the water and it begins freezing in layers, so all of your ice comes out round and is hollow in the center. Once the freezing time elapses the rods go back up and the ice is pushed into the basket for serving. I hope this helps.",2.5191831568531597

Problem is the bucket the ice goes in is small, and once it's full it stops making ice until you empty it. So, if you stood there and babysat it, emptying the ice into your ice bin every 20 minutes or so, you could fill a large bin in less than 2 hours. The ice that comes out is only 32 degrees (and melting), and the ice bin in your refrigerator is usually around zero degrees so the ice will stick together as it cools down. My guess is one refill of water would be all you need to stock up your refrigerator.",5.049908974604512
